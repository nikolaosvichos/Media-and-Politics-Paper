How do early political experiences during moments of democratic strain shape long-term attitudes toward liberal democratic protections of media freedom (media attitudes)? This paper examines whether coming of age politically in the context of the 2016 Trump election—characterized by persistent attacks against the press—durably alters individuals’ attitudinal trajectories. Using a sharp regression discontinuity design (RDD), I compare Americans whose first eligible presidential election was 2012 to those whose first eligible election was 2016, leveraging the age-based cutoff in the 2020 ANES. The regression discontinuity (RD) results reveal little evidence of the predicted effects and, where effects do appear, they run largely counter to expectations. Across most subgroups, there is no detectable shift in media attitudes. The few significant estimates point in the opposite direction: Republicans first eligible to vote in 2016 expressed more positive media attitudes, whereas the inverse was true among independents. Taken together, the results raise the possibility that early exposure to Trump’s norm-breaking campaign may have triggered a form of resistance or retrospective distancing rather than ideological adoption that was contingent on political engagement. These findings provide new insight into how political generations are formed under disruptive conditions while raising broader questions about the fragility and conditionality of democratic commitments in the electorate.

\section{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{Introduction}}{Introduction}}\label{introduction}

The 2016 U.S. presidential election marked a rupture in American
political life. Supporters chanted ``Lock her up!'' as protestors were
forcibly removed from rallies, while journalists and the media were
routinely framed as enemies of the people. For many young voters, this
was their first political memory as adults. If early political
experiences are formative, what are the downstream consequences of
coming of age during an election defined by persistent attacks against
the liberal democratic media protections? This leads to the central
question of this paper:

\begin{adjustwidth}{1em}{1em}
\emph{Does entering political life during a disruptive and polarizing election shape long-term attitudes toward liberal democratic protections of media freedom?}
\end{adjustwidth}

To answer this question, I use a sharp regression discontinuity design
(RDD) leveraging the age-based cutoff for voting eligibility in the 2012
and 2016 presidential elections. By comparing individuals just eligible
to vote in 2012 with those just eligible in 2016, I isolate the causal
effect of entering the electorate during a conventional electoral
context versus one characterized by intensified rhetoric against freedom
of the press.

Across most partisanship-based subgroups, the results show no evidence
that first-time exposure to the 2016 election increased hostility toward
liberal protections of media freedom. Where significant effects do
appear, they point in the opposite direction: Republicans exhibit
\emph{lower} levels of hostility, whereas the inverse is true for
independents. Overall, the results run counter to prevailing
expectations about impressionable-years sensitivity to elite cues.

\subsection{Importance}\label{importance}

Understanding whether and how attitudes toward liberal democratic
protections of media freedom (hereinafter referred to as `media
attitudes') might take root is central to assessing the long-term
resilience of liberal democracy. Young voters are particularly receptive
to their political environment when they first engage with democratic
institutions; early adulthood thus exerts disproportionate influence on
long-term political attitudes and behaviors
(\citeproc{ref-jennings2014}{Jennings and Niemi 2014};
\citeproc{ref-ghitza2023}{Ghitza, Gelman, and Auerbach 2023}).
Therefore, studying how this cohort responds to periods of elite norm
violation can offer critical insights into the conditions under which
hostile media attitudes can emerge and an erosion of democratic norms
against the `fourth branch' of government might gain traction.

This study can also contribute to understanding the `stickiness' of
elite cues during early adulthood. Such top-down cues play a central
role in shaping how citizens interpret political conflict, particularly
when elites signal that violations of democratic norms are permissible
or necessary (\citeproc{ref-druckman2024}{Druckman 2024};
\citeproc{ref-clayton2021}{Clayton et al. 2021}). Although such cues
influence the public broadly, their impact might be amplified among
young adults. Their heightened sensitivity to their political context
makes early adulthood a critical window for understanding how exposure
to elite norm breaking may anchor long-term orientations toward hostile
media attitudes.

Finally, the importance of this study extends beyond academia: if
exposure to norm violations during early adulthood can lead to hostile
media attitudes and weakened democratic commitments, the long-term costs
of elite transgression may be generational as well as institutional.
Democratic backsliding might thus unfold subtly, through shifts in what
young citizens come to view as acceptable in a democracy. If such
attitudes take root precisely when political identities are forming, the
effects may endure long after the precipitating crisis has passed. This
possibility raises the question of whether democracy can survive if its
newest citizens come of age during moments of elite norm violation.

\section{Literature Review}\label{literature-review}

This paper draws on two strands of literature to examine how coming of
age under a norm-breaking election may shape long-term media attitudes.
The first explores how early adulthood functions as a sensitive period
for political and civic development, with political attitudes and
behaviors formed during this time often persisting throughout adulthood.
Secondly, recent research on democratic backsliding highlights the
importance of elite cues in shaping public attitudes and commitments to
democratic norms. Taken together, these strands provide a framework for
analyzing how exposure to the 2016 Trump election may have affected the
political development of young voters.

\subsection{Early Adulthood and Future Political
Behavior}\label{early-adulthood-and-future-political-behavior}

Existing research has underscored the enduring impact of childhood and
early adulthood on later-life outcomes: one of the main domains in which
this is most evident is political attitudes.

Mannheim (\citeproc{ref-mannheim1928}{1928}) introduces the concept of
`fresh contact,' arguing that initial encounters with political
authority and conflict during this time help crystallize lasting
political worldviews. Recent empirical work supports this idea:
Neundorf, Smets, and García-Albacete (\citeproc{ref-neundorf2013}{2013})
use German panel data to show that political interest develops most
dynamically during adolescence and early adulthood, stabilizing around
age 25. Similarly, Dinas (\citeproc{ref-dinas2013}{2013}), studying
reactions to the Watergate scandal, finds that young adults adjust their
political evaluations more flexibly than older cohorts by placing less
weight on prior attitudes, suggesting an openness to new information.

A related line of research explores how generations differ in their
long-term political behavior based on when they came of age. Ghitza,
Gelman, and Auerbach (\citeproc{ref-ghitza2023}{2023}) find that
political preferences are largely shaped by events encountered between
ages 14 and 24, and that cohort-defining moments like the Kennedy,
Reagan, or Trump years create stable partisan divides. Longitudinal data
confirm that political orientations established in this period often
endure: Jennings and Niemi (\citeproc{ref-jennings2014}{2014}), drawing
on decades of panel data, find that attitudes formed in early adulthood
tend to persist across life, especially for individuals who engaged
politically early on.

One of the clearest applications of the formative nature of early
adulthood lies in the act of voting for the first time. Dinas
(\citeproc{ref-dinas2012}{2012}) finds that voting in a first election
increases the likelihood of voting in subsequent elections, even decades
later. This finding is echoed by Franklin
(\citeproc{ref-franklin2004}{2004}) , who argues that the overall
`salience' of a young person's first election (whether it begins with a
high- or low-turnout context) leaves a footprint in their participation
trajectory. These findings reinforce the idea that initial political
experiences, like exposure to and participation in salient elections,
become reference points that influence later engagement.

Taken together, this literature positions early adulthood as a formative
and fragile window, where social contexts and political experience leave
lasting marks on civic behavior. Nevertheless, less is known about how
this sensitivity interacts with moments of crisis. This paper
contributes to this literature by examining whether coming of age during
a period marked by elite violations of liberal democratic norms toward
media freedom shapes long-term media attitudes. In doing so, it connects
theories of developmental susceptibility with contemporary concerns
about democratic backsliding.

\subsection{Trump 2016 and the Trickling-Down of Media
Attitudes}\label{trump-2016-and-the-trickling-down-of-media-attitudes}

The 2016 U.S. presidential election marked an important rupture, both in
tone and behavior, that distinguished it sharply from previous
elections. In addition to being ``one of the most polarizing elections
in U.S. history'', pitting two extremely ideologically opposed
candidates, the 2016 election also stands out particularly due to
candidacy of Donald Trump (\citeproc{ref-bekafigo2019}{Bekafigo et al.
2019}).

\subsubsection{Trump and the media}\label{trump-and-the-media}

Trump's campaign style was---and still is---in many ways unprecedented.
Most importantly for the purposes of this paper, his 2016 campaign was
characterized by systematic attacks on the news media as a core
democratic institution. Through an extensive content analysis of Trump's
Twitter activity, Meeks (\citeproc{ref-meeks2020}{2020}) shows that
Trump attacked non-conservative and mainstream media using attack and
bias frames. These attacks generated particularly high levels of
engagement, suggesting strong resonance among his supporters. Such
rhetoric targeted the media not merely as political adversaries but as
enemies of the people, thereby undermining the liberal democratic norm
of an independent press (\citeproc{ref-kenny2020}{Kenny 2020}).

\subsubsection{Elite cues and anti-democratic
attitudes}\label{elite-cues-and-anti-democratic-attitudes}

While the 2016 election marked a clear breach in elite behavior, the
broader effects of this rupture also depend on how citizens respond.
Findings from the literature on democratic erosion suggest that elite
norm violations can destabilize democratic institutions. Elites are
uniquely positioned to violate norms, often under the guise of defending
democracy itself whereas citizens function as latent legitimators,
responding to elite behavior and helping either to normalize or resist
democratic erosion (\citeproc{ref-druckman2024}{Druckman 2024}).

This is corroborated by empirical findings. Using a panel survey
experiment, Clayton et al. (\citeproc{ref-clayton2021}{2021}) examine
the effect of exposure to Trump's statements questioning the results of
the 2020 presidential election and find that exposure to these
statements eroded trust in the election's legitimacy among his
supporters. This suggests that anti-democratic elite cues can
`trickle-down,' impacting public attitudes toward democratic norms.
Focusing specifically on the media, Smith
(\citeproc{ref-smith2010}{2010}) shows that elite attacks against the
media, regardless of partisanship or timing relative to news exposure,
systematically increase citizens' perceptions of media bias, benefiting
political elites while weakening democratic accountability.

This study builds on these insights: while existing work documents the
democratic consequences of Trump's presidency, less is known about how
exposure to this political moment shaped long-term political
development. This paper addresses that gap by examining whether coming
of age under Trump altered long-term media attitudes.

\subsection{Theory and Hypotheses}\label{theory-and-hypotheses}

Building on these insights, I introduce my theoretical framework and
hypotheses outlining how early political socialization, partisan
sensitivity, and the ideologically asymmetric effects of political
context shape long-term liberal democratic attitudes.

\subsubsection{H1: First-Time
Sensitivity}\label{h1-first-time-sensitivity}

Early adulthood is politically formative, as experiences during this
period can leave long-lasting marks on political behavior. This paper
applies this logic to the context of the 2016 presidential election;
unlike earlier cohorts, first-time voters in 2016 `came of age'
politically during a time characterized by norm-breaking elite rhetoric
like hostile media attitudes. Given this norm-eroding context, I argue
that the process of attitude formation becomes distorted at the moment
it is most sticky.

This leads to the central claim tested in this study, reflecting both
the sensitivity of early political experiences and the unique nature of
the 2016 election:\footnote{A negative effect indicates a
  \emph{decrease} in support for liberal democratic protections of the
  media among those eligible to vote for the first time in \emph{2016,}
  compared to those eligible in 2012.}

\begin{adjustwidth}{1em}{1em}
\emph{H1: Being first eligible to vote in the 2016 U.S. presidenial election will have a negative effect on long-term media attitudes ('first-time sensitivity' hypothesis).}
\end{adjustwidth}

\subsubsection{H2: Non-Partisan
Insensitivity}\label{h2-non-partisan-insensitivity}

Existing research suggests that political partisanship shapes how
individuals interpret and respond to their political environment.
Whereas partisan identifiers, especially strong ones, tend to be more
psychologically and behaviorally sensitive to political stimuli,
self-identified independents are generally less responsive.

Mandel and Omorogbe (\citeproc{ref-mandel2014}{2014}) find that
partisans report higher life satisfaction under favorable political
conditions and lower satisfaction under unfavorable ones, while
independents express intermediate levels. This `favorability effect'
suggests that partisans are more emotionally attuned to political
developments whereas independents are less susceptible to affective
spillover from the political context. In terms of political behavior,
Magleby, Nelson, and Westlye (\citeproc{ref-magleby2011}{2011}) find
that independents vote at significantly lower rates than partisans. This
turnout gap---nearly 20 percentage points in the 2008
election---suggests lower overall political involvement.

These findings suggest that independents are less likely to internalize
elite cues associated with polarized political contexts and thus may
have been less susceptible to the Trump's cues. This leads to my second
hypothesis:

\begin{adjustwidth}{1em}{1em}
\emph{H2: The effect will be stronger among partisans (Republicans or Democrats) than among independents ('non-partisan insensitivity' hypothesis).}
\end{adjustwidth}

\subsubsection{H3: Asymmetric
Sensitivity}\label{h3-asymmetric-sensitivity}

My final hypothesis builds on the ``asymmetric sensitivity'' hypothesis
proposed Mandel and Omorogbe (\citeproc{ref-mandel2014}{2014}), positing
that Republicans are more affectively responsive to their political
environment than Democrats: their retrospective and prospective
well-being was more strongly conditioned by whether the political
environment was favorable or not. Democrats, by contrast, were less
reactive.

This pattern is consistent with research showing that conservatives are
more likely to attend to and be affected by charged or threatening
information. For example, Joel, Burton, and Plaks
(\citeproc{ref-joel2014}{2014}) find that conservatives not only
anticipate stronger emotional reactions to negative outcomes but also
report experiencing them more intensely.

These findings, in addition to the fact that the elite cues of hostility
toward liberal democratic protections of the media came primarily from
the Republican side, imply that Republican first-time voters may have
been more deeply affected by the political context of 2016. Rather than
resisting Trump's anti-media cues, they may have internalized them as
acceptable (\citeproc{ref-cremer2023}{Cremer 2023};
\citeproc{ref-knuckey2022}{Knuckey and Hassan 2022}). This leads to my
final hypothesis:

\begin{adjustwidth}{1em}{1em}
\emph{H3: Among partisans, the effect will be stronger among Republicans ('asymmetric sensitivity' hypothesis).}
\end{adjustwidth}

\section{Research Design}\label{research-design}

This study uses a sharp RDD to identify the long-term causal impact of
being first eligible to vote during a `conventional' versus
`unconventional' period and political environment on voters' media
attitudes. The core idea is that young people who were just old enough
to vote in the 2012 U.S. presidential election (i.e., age 18 by November
2012) experienced a fundamentally different initial political
environment than those who were just too young. While the former `came
of age' politically during the 2012 election between Barack Obama and
Mitt Romney, the latter were first eligible to vote in 2016, during the
Trump era.

This design translates into a cutoff at age 26 in 2020 (the year for
which data is used): respondents who were 26 or older in 2020 were just
old enough to vote in 2012, while those under 26 were not. The
assumption underlying the RDD is that, within a narrow bandwidth around
this cutoff, the `treatment' (being born after November 6, 2012) is
as-good-as-randomly assigned. The local comparison around the threshold
thus simulates an experiment where this `treatment' is assigned by birth
timing.

I estimate a flexible\footnote{Of course, this version can take a linear
  form; however, it is also generalizable to higher polynomial degrees.}
RDD, since linear models may miss non-linearities in how the outcome
evolves with age, This can be expressed as:

\[
Y_i = \alpha + \tau D_i + f(X_i - c) + \varepsilon_i
\]

Where:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \(Y_i\): Outcome, measuring media attitudes
\item
  \(D_i\): Dummy indicator equal to 1 if individual \(i\)'s age
  \emph{exceeds} the cutoff (i.e., \emph{eligible} to vote in 2012), and
  0 otherwise.\footnote{This might seem counter-intuitive, since the
    group of interest (young voters) becomes, in a sense, the `control
    group'. This is due to the specific design of the R package used
    (rdrobust), which estimates causal effects when the running variable
    crosses the cut-off.}
\item
  \(\tau\) : Parameter capturing the Local Average Treatment Effect.
\item
  \(X_i\): Running variable (age in 2020)
\item
  \(f(X_i - c)\): Flexible function (e.g., first- or higher-order
  polynomial) of the centered running variable---distance from the
  cutoff \(c\).
\item
  \(c = 26\): Cut-off, so \(X_i - c\) represents the running variable
  centered at the threshold.
\item
  \(\varepsilon_i\): Error term.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Data and Index
Construction}\label{data-and-index-construction}

The analysis draws on the 2020 American National Election Studies
(\citeproc{ref-anes}{ANES 2021}) cross-sectional survey. To capture
media attitudes, I used factor analysis to construct a 0-1 index
consisting of three items, presented in Table~\ref{tbl-items}. Higher
values indicate stronger support for liberal democratic protections of
media freedom.

\section{Results}\label{results}

This section presents the findings of this paper. I begin by visualizing
the discontinuity near the 26-year-old threshold for the full sample and
subgroups. I then present the results, analyzing them by hypothesis.

\subsection{Discontinuities}\label{discontinuities}

Figure~\ref{fig-discontinuityplot-full} visualizes the discontinuity
around the threshold for the full-sample. Upon visual inspection, there
is no clear discontinuity and the overall clutter makes it difficult to
discern any patterns.

Attitudes at Age 26 (Full Sample, First Degree Polynomial)}

\end{figure}%

Figure~\ref{fig-discontinuityplot-subgroups} shows the discontinuity at
the threshold for the subgroups. There appears to be a discontinuity in
the Independents and Republicans subgroups, though CIs slightly overlap
so no conclusions can be drawn from visual inspection. Interestingly,
contrary to my predictions, `coming of age' politically under Trump
might have a positive effect\footnote{A positive effect indicates an
  \emph{increase} in support for liberal democratic protections of the
  media among those voting for the first time in \emph{2016.}} on
Republicans' media attitudes and a negative effect on independents.

\subsection{RDD Results}\label{rdd-results}

Results are visualized in Figure~\ref{fig-coefplot-results}. The points
represent the estimated causal effect at the cutoff, and the horizontal
lines show the associated 95\% CIs.

\end{figure}%

The results, summarized below, are quite perplexing.\footnote{The
  direction of the results should be interpreted in accordance with the
  wording of the first-time sensitivity hypothesis: a positive effect
  indicates an increase in support for liberal democratic protections of
  the media among those voting for the first time in 2016

  However, in reality, these results have been inverted. This is because
  of the rdrobust R package (\citeproc{ref-calonico2025}{Calonico,
  Cattaneo, and Farrell 2025}). In the package, the threshold is
  ``crossed'' from left to right---hence, normally, a positive effect
  would suggest an \emph{increase} in support for liberal democratic
  norms toward media freedom among those who voted for the first time in
  \emph{2012.} However, for clearer comprehension, the results have been
  reversed. For more details on index construction, please refer to the
  \href{https://github.com/nikolaosvichos/Media-and-Politics-Paper/tree/main/Appendix}{online
  appendix.}

  Due to the perplexing nature of these results, I ran a number of
  `rule-of-thumb' tests to confirm that the direction of the index is
  the intended one, such as checking if it is negatively or positively
  correlated with items used in its construction or other variables that
  we would expect to be correlated with the outcomes in a specific way
  (for example, higher education levels correlated with lower support
  for authoritarianism). These tests confirmed that the direction of the
  indices is the intended one.} First, most results are statistically
insignificant, indicating that `coming of age' under Trump mostly has no
long-term effects on media attitudes. The first notable exception is the
strong and statistically significant negative effect
(\textasciitilde17\%) on media attitudes among independents: this goes
contrary to H2, which predicted that the negative effect would be
greater among partisans. Even more surprisingly, there was a
statistically significant strong positive effect (\textasciitilde15\%)
among Republicans. This suggests the exact opposite from what I
predicted: Republicans who `came of age' under Trump are \emph{more}
supportive of liberal democratic protections of media freedom. Both
exceptions are robust to the inclusion of controls. Results are
summarized in Table~\ref{tbl-results}

\section{Conclusion and Discussion}\label{conclusion-and-discussion}

This paper set out to examine whether the timing of democratic
initiation---specifically, becoming eligible to vote during the 2016
U.S. presidential election---shapes long-term media attitudes. Drawing
on theories of political socialization, elite cue-taking, and asymmetric
partisan sensitivity, I tested whether `coming of age' politically in a
moment of hostile elite rhetoric toward the media would leave a
measurable imprint on voter attitudes.

The findings are counter-intuitive. First, independents voting for the
first time in 2016 indicated more \emph{negative} media attitudes than
partisans, contradicting existing work suggesting that independents are
\emph{less} sensitive to their political context
(\citeproc{ref-magleby2011}{Magleby, Nelson, and Westlye 2011}). Even
more surprisingly, `coming of age' during the 2016 election led to
\emph{greater} long-term support for liberal democratic protections of
media freedom among Republicans. This suggests a partisan asymmetry,
albeit one in the reverse direction of what I hypothesized.

These findings have important implications on our understanding of
political socialization and the stickiness of elite cues. At first, they
suggest that first-time voters are resistant to the trickle-down
adoption of negative media attitudes, pointing to a backlash effect
where exposure to norm-questioning elite cues reinforces these norms
among the public. Additionally, the presence of a negative effect among
independents and a positive effect among Republicans (respectively, the
least and most sensitive citizens to their political context, according
to Mandel and Omorogbe (\citeproc{ref-mandel2014}{2014})) hints that
political involvement might be an important predictor of whether this
backlash takes place. Hence, increasing citizens' engagement with
politics could be an antidote against democratic backsliding.

However, given the broader context of existing literature, these
counter-intuitive findings also admit three darker interpretations.
First, as Graham and Svolik (\citeproc{ref-graham2020}{2020}) argue,
ordinary citizens often express broad opposition to illiberal or
undemocratic attitudes when asked in the abstract, but this support may
evaporate when those principles conflict with partisan interests.
Because the ANES items used here were not embedded in a trade-off or
priming design, they likely captured only nominal or superficial
attitudes. Some Republicans might thus have voted for Trump not because
of his hostile rhetoric toward the media but in spite of it: they might
reject his rhetoric, yet continue to support him on policy grounds. A
second possibility is one of anticipatory support for liberal democratic
norms. Drawing from Kingzette et al.
(\citeproc{ref-kingzette2021}{2021}), in affectively polarized contexts
partisans whose party is in power often turn against liberal democratic
norms whereas those in opposition seek to uphold them, recognizing them
as vital for their political survival. Given Biden's consistent lead in
the polls (\citeproc{ref-pewresearchcenter2020}{Pew Research Center
2020}), Republicans might have begun preparing for a scenario where they
would find themselves in opposition by preemptively increasing their
support for liberal democratic protections. In both scenarios, those who
were first eligible in 2016 might have been more likely to accept these
anti-democratic trade-offs due to having been socialized in a
norm-questioning environment that normalized such attitudes.

However, these explanations do not account for the strong negative
effect among independents, who presumably are the least likely to make
such a trade-off (\citeproc{ref-graham2020}{Graham and Svolik 2020}). A
final, albeit imperfect, explanation concerns differences in media
consumption and the accidental and asymmetrical priming effects of the
survey wording. Partisans increasingly follow like-minded sources
(\citeproc{ref-peterson2021}{Peterson, Goel, and Iyengar 2021}); as a
result, when responding to the survey, Republicans---especially those
who `came of age' in 2016---might have been accidentally primed into
`safeguarding' only conservative media, which were also heavily praised
by Trump in his campaign (\citeproc{ref-meeks2020}{Meeks 2020}).
Independents, on the other hand, might have been primed to think about
the polarized media environment that characterized both the 2016 and
2020 electoral races. If this priming provokes a negative reaction
(\citeproc{ref-arceneaux2015}{Arceneaux and Johnson 2015}), they might
turn increasingly hostile to the media as a whole and, by extension, the
liberal democratic norms protecting them. This effect might be more
pronounced among those who were first eligible to vote in 2016 not
because of a greater hostility toward the media environment but because
of a greater willingness to translate this hostility into negative media
attitudes, as a result of being socialized in a norm-violating context.

That said, several limitations temper the interpretation of these
results. Most notably, not only is the sample size for each subgroup
quite small but, while effects are robust to the addition of controls,
they sometimes lose their significance under alternative polynomial
degree or bandwidth specifications (see
\href{https://github.com/nikolaosvichos/Media-and-Politics-Paper/tree/main/Appendix}{online
appendix} for robustness checks). Additionally, the assignment variable
used to define voting eligibility (age in years) is a blunt proxy that
fails to capture exact birthdates, introducing measurement error near
the cutoff. Finally, this paper truly examines medium- rather than
long-term effects, as it studies attitudes only four years later than
the first exposure in 2016.

Future work could address these gaps in several ways. Researchers should
replicate this design using datasets that include exact birthdates,
improving causal precision near the eligibility threshold. Additionally,
using more recent data (e.g., 2024 ANES) could allow for studying
longer-term trends and help determine whether early exposure to hostile
elite cues produces lasting attitudinal change. Third, this study
assumed that the voting eligibility itself is enough to trigger this
political `coming of age.' However, this also includes a sizeable
proportion of young adults who were eligible to vote but chose not to.
Future research could instead examine the effect of first-time
\emph{voting}, through a fuzzy RDD design that uses eligibility as the
instrumental variable. Finally, applying the same logic to other
political transitions, like Bolsonaro's 2018 election or the AfD's
third-place finish in Germany in 2017, could reveal whether these
dynamics are context-dependent or broadly generalizable.

In sum, while these findings complicate our assumptions about the
development of attitudes toward liberal democratic institutions, they
might ultimately be reinforcing its most worrying implication: the
resilience of liberal democracy cannot be taken for granted, not even
among its newest members.
