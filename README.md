# Online Appendix: Coming of Age Under Trump
This repository includes the online appendix as well as other materials for the "Coming of Age Under Trump" paper. To view the appendix, you just need to download the file and open it in your browser. 

I have also included two replication code files for the main analysis, excluding the Appendix. `ReplicationCode_Full.R` includes everything, whereas `ReplicationCode_NoFunctions.R` is a neater version that draws its functions from `functions.R` to reduce clutter. To run the replication code, you can download the dataset (*STATA file*) from the [American National Election Studies website](https://electionstudies.org/data-center/2020-time-series-study/)
