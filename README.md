# Online Appendix: Coming of Age Under Trump
This repository includes the online appendix as well as other materials for the "Coming of Age Under Trump" paper. To view the appendix, you just need to download the file and open it in your browser. 

I have also included two replication code files for the main analysis, excluding the Appendix. `ReplicationCode_Full.R` includes everything, whereas `ReplicationCode_NoFunctions.R` is a neater version that draws its functions from `functions.R` to reduce clutter.

Note on wordcount: 
- The final wordcount for this paper was 3,302 words (I was not able to find a way to put this in the PDF rendering of the .qmd file.
- However, please note that the specific package used ('wordcount' by Andrew Heiss) has had some inaccuracies in the past, at least in my experience.
